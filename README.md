# zen-erating boilerplates

I always need to Google everytime I want to have configs for Docker, Kubernetes, ... It's time-consuming and to be honest, I couldn't remember their syntax very well. That's why zen was born.

## Install

Make sure you already installed Go, then install zen binary

```
go install github.com/zelic91/zen
```

In order to run all Go binaries globally, you need to include `/go/bin` in the PATH as (in ~/.zshrc for example):

```
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
```

## Notes

This is a very limited package which is built for my own need, you might find it very silly and clumpsy. If so, ignore it. Thanks.
